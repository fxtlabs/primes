// Package primes provides simple functionality for working with prime numbers.

// Call Sieve(n) to generate all prime numbers less than or equal to n,
// IsPrime(n) to test for primality, Coprime(a,b) to test for coprimality,
// and Pi(n) to count (or estimate) the number of primes less than or equal to n.

// The algorithms used to implement the functions above are fairly simple;
